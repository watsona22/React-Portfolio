                Hello and welcome! Thanks for stopping by to check out my portfolio.
                My name is Amber Watson, recent graduate of the edX Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Texas in Austin.
                You will find five deliverables from every major section of the course program.
                Those five projects are accessible via an interactive page, complete with functionality and responsive design feautures consistent with industry standards.
                Please feel free to peruse the site and contact me with any questions you have.
